   topic: "Infotainment Systems",
   text: "13. The number and type of peripherals that are included and the way they are set up within\nan infotainment system depends on the level of functionality that a given OEM wants to\noffer within a given physical architecture of the car and that OEM's given design\nrequirement. The notifying party submits that dividing OEM infotainment systems by\nthe functionalities they provide or the devices they use to provide such functionalities\nwould artificially create a myriad of product markets that would not capture the\ncompetition among OEM infotainment system providers to meet the demands of OEMs\nand consumers for integrated solutions. The notifying party submits that all infotainment\nsystems possess the following common characteristics which distinguish them from the\nmarkets for the individual components or peripherals that may be included in such\nsystems:\n\n• certain hardware : i.e., a central computing platform, commonly known as the\nhead unit\"\n• certain software: i.e., Operating System, software which enables the driver to\ncommand and control the various entertainment and information devices that\nconnect to the 'head unit' so that they can all operate together as an integrated\nsystem via a common driver interface,\n• a control or gateway interface function to the overall vehicle network.\n\n14. All infotainment system competitors in the Commission's market investigation agreed\nthat infotainment systems share certain hardware and software including the 'head unit'.\nOne respondent however did not agree that all such systems have a control or gateway\ninterface function to the overall vehicle network. For the purposes of the present case,\nhowever, the exact product market definition for infotainment systems may be left open\nas the proposed transaction does not raise serious doubts."

   topic: "Geographic Market for Infotainment Systems",
   text: "15. The notifying party submits that the market for OEM infotainment systems is EEA-wide\nfor the following reasons. First, OEM infotainment systems are sold throughout the EEA\nand there are no barriers to their sale in any EEA country. Second, the OEM\ninfotainment systems that are sold throughout the EEA all provide similar functions.\nThird, the major suppliers of infotainment systems are active throughout the EEA.\nFinally there are transmission standards for mobile phones and dynamic traffic\ninformation that differentiate the European market from other markets.\n\n16. Responses in the market investigation from both infotainment system suppliers and\nOEM customers indicated that the geographic market for such systems may in fact be\nglobal as suppliers are active in all main markets and major customers source such\nsystems on a global basis. One respondent nuanced this view by noting the widespread\nuse of the MOST\ndata communication protocol in European manufactured vehicles as\nopposed to those manufactured elsewhere. It therefore suggested that the customer base\nfor infotainment systems using the MOST protocol could be EEA.\n\n17. For the purposes of the present case, however, the exact geographic market definition\nmay be left open as the proposed transaction does not give rise to serious doubts."

The notifying party submits that mixing consoles could be split into four sub-categories:\npublic address systems (i.e. amplification products used as a communication system in a\npublic area; tour sound systems; installed sound systems and for recording and\nbroadcasting.\n\n20. Mixing console competitors in the market investigation agreed that the categorisation\nmentioned above was a reasonable basis on which to classify mixing consoles. For the\npurposes of the present case, however, the exact product market definition may be left\nopen as the proposed transaction does not raise serious doubts (see below)."

   topic: "Fiber Optic Transceivers (FOTs)",
   text: "23. The notifying party considers on the basis of certain supply and demand considerations\nthat FOTs can be divided into three categories: automotive, general purpose (or\nnetworking) and industrial. Automotive FOTs can be distinguished from other types of\nFOT in that they comply with standard specifications used in the automotive industry\n(namely the Byteflight or MOST specifications). Although automotive FOTs can in\ntheory be used in a number of non-automotive applications, customers in the automotive\nindustry will not accept non-automotive FOTs. This was confirmed by respondents in\nthe market investigation.\n\n24. Industrial and general purpose FOTs are differentiated from automotive FOTs in that\nthey are not required to meet the Byteflight or MOST specifications. General purpose\n(or networking) FOTs have different optical solutions from automotive and industrial\nFOTs as they use different lasers/detectors and combine the transmitting and receiving\nfunction into a single package and operate on either a multimode or single mode optical\nfiber. As industrial FOTs are not used by Harman in any of its applications, they are not\nconsidered further. Similarly, as the Byteflight data protocol is being phased out and\nbecause Harman uses only MOST automotive FOTs in its infotainment systems, the\nsubsequent analysis focuses on MOST automotive FOTs.\n\n25. For the purposes of the present case however the precise product market definition may\nbe left open as the proposed transaction will not result in a significant impediment to\neffective competition even on the basis of the narrowest product market definition of\nautomotive FOTs where Avago's market share is the highest."

The notifying party submits the market for automotive FOTs is worldwide in that\nsuppliers sell to customers located all around the world, there are no significant price\ndifferences between countries and transport costs are low. It submits that this is in line\nwith previous Commission decisions concerning electronic components.\n\n27. The majority of automotive FOTs are ultimately incorporated into vehicles\nmanufactured in Europe, and Germany in particular. Respondents in the market\ninvestigation indicated that competitive conditions for the supply of MOST certified\nFOTs are similar between the Member States of the EEA and also between the EEA and\nother markets, thereby supporting the view that the market for automotive FOTs is\nindeed worldwide.\n\n28. The precise geographic market may be left open in the present case however as the\nproposed transaction does not give rise to serious doubts either at an EEA or worldwide\nlevel."

From a supply-side perspective, there are\nno barriers to supplying optocouplers for any end use.\n\n31. On the basis of the responses to the Commission's market investigation, it has not been\npossible to determine with certainty the precise product market definition for\noptocouplers. Whilst one of the largest optocoupler manufacturers expressed the view\nthat all producers supplied a broad range of optocouplers, another believed that\nproducers tended to specialise in certain types. At the same time, the majority of mixing\nconsole competitors indicated they did not have sufficient knowledge to say whether all\noptocoupler producers supply broadly similar ranges. For the purposes of the present\ncase however the precise product market definition may be left open as the proposed\ntransaction does not give rise to serious doubts (see below)."

    text: "(13) As regards genericised products11, the Commission has taken the view that the molecule level (or possibly group of molecules considered interchangeable) is the most plausible starting point for the product market definition, given that generic pharmaceutical companies typically produce copies of originator drugs12 and thus it can be considered that a generic molecule is the closest substitute to the originator medicinal product based on the same molecule or API13. As set out in the Commission's horizontal merger guidelines14, the higher the degree of substitutability between the merging firms' products, the more likely it is that the merging firms will raise prices significantly15."

    text: "(14) A potential distinction between generic and proprietary medicines was considered by the Commission. For example, in a previous case16 the Commission made a distinction between originator and generic medicinal products stating that there is a separate market for the wholesale of generic medicines as compared to the wholesale of proprietary medicines17. In other cases18, however, the Commission set out that where the market is genericised, originator drugs and generics could be considered to be close substitutes for a given indication and a product market may be defined as including both the generic and the proprietary medicine."

    text: "(16) The affected markets in the present case are identified based on the molecule level as well as at ATC3 and ATC4 level. (17) Given the characteristics of the products involved in the present case (mature genericised medicinal products), the Commission takes the molecule level as the most plausible starting point for the product market definition. Where there is no overlap at molecule level, the Commission takes the ATC3 or ATC4 level as a starting point reference to assess therapeutic and economic substitutability across molecules. In the present case the exact ATC level and the question whether ATC3 need to be further segmented to ATC4 can be left open as the Transaction does not raise doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market irrespective of the precise market definition."

    topic: "Generic and Originator Products",
    text: "(18) Regarding a potential distinction between originator and generic products during the market investigation in the present case the respondents did not point out specificities other than brand recognition and price that differentiate the originator products from the generic products19. In this regard, even if brand loyalty to the originator medicine may play a role in limiting switching in certain instances, competition takes place between originator and generic providers20. Therefore, for the purposes of the competitive assessment of the Transaction, the Commission considers that in relation to the overlapping molecules the product market includes both generic and originator versions in relation to the overlapping molecules."
